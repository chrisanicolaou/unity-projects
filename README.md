## Overview

The following projects are small games, each of which serve to build my practical experience with the Unity game engine. I adopted a functionality first approach, with my main focus being learning and implementing different components of Unity, rather than producing beautifully polished games.

**If you would like to play, follow the [download](#download-and-play) section**.

**If you would like to run the source code in Unity, continue on to [setup](#setup)**.

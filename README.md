## Overview

The following projects are small games, each of which serve to build my practical experience with the Unity game engine. I adopted a functionality first approach, with my main focus being learning and implementing different components of Unity, rather than producing beautifully polished games.

## Setup

**Prerequisites**: [UnityHub](https://unity.com/download), [Unity (version 2020.3.28)](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

Before you begin, open UnityHub, follow any setup steps required, and make sure you have the correct Unity version installed.

Head to the [projects](#projects) section of this repo and find a game you're interested in running.

In UnityHub, click "open" and locate the folder created from the cloned repo.

UnityHub will now open the project in Unity.

## Projects

The projects below are ordered by most recently created - as such, they typically build on my experience gained from the lower-down projects, while focusing on new features and components of Unity that I had not yet experimented with.
